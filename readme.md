# Programming language

## Idea
-   This will be a high level, object oriented programming language
-   It will be compiled and optimized to the corresponding C code

## syntax
-   semicolons are optional
-   strings are mutable
-   primitves are passed by copy, objects passed by reference. Use .copy() on an object to pass it by copy (may be compiled out anyway)
-   Main class is required
-   every class inherits from a base object
-   allow overloading based on argument types
-   allow keyword arguments
-   if, while, and for-each do not require parenthesis
-   "garbage collection" handled at compile time
-   allow compile time multithreading, simt, and gpu setup
-   allow list (dynamic array) and array as built-in types
-   Compiler will complain if you change the size of a non-dynamic type
-   allow inline assembly
-   allow different possible arguments with |
-   allow use statements to shorten names
-   use $ to denote a test (should return true or false as to whether or not the test passed)
-   use @ to denote documentation should contain documentation for the function/class
-   allow multiple inheritance
-   use # to denote a compiler directive (will be important for writing low level)
